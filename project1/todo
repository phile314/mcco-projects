things that need to be corrected in the output

MV- ag/Converter decoupling
        ag validates bibtexentry and returns preprocessed entry
        create Htmll class    

MV- Names convention for the most common cases (see http://maverick.inria.fr/~Xavier.Decoret/resources/xdkbibtex/bibtex_summary.html for a specification)
PH- Double dash in ranges (--)
PH- Field delimiters in the html output:
        Author, Title: '.'
        Editor: 'In: ' .... ', editors'
        ....
        fieldToHtml add suffixes and prefixes, 
        there has to be a way to specifiy seperator. Probably a map Field -> Char, and should have a default of ','
MV- User Key derivation
MV- correct anchors, solved, has to be checked
PH- HTML Indentation can be improved


  - More example (both succeding and failing)
  - Doc.pdf needs some more text
